# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling within route handlers that interact with databases.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that fetches user data from a database.  However, it fails to handle potential errors during the database operation. If an error occurs (e.g., database connection failure, query error), the application crashes or returns an incomplete response.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route handler. It uses a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during database operations.  If an error occurs, it sends an appropriate error response to the client, preventing application crashes and providing informative error messages.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (assuming you have a database set up).
3. Run `node bug.js` (This will likely crash if database interaction is not properly handled.)
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` (This version should handle errors gracefully.)
